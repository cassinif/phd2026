# PhD course 2026 -- Advances in Numerical Analysis and Mathematical Modelling: exponential integrators for evolutionary quations

Lecturers: **Marco Caliari** and **Fabio Cassini**


This course explores the theory, development, and application of exponential
integrators in the numerical solution of evolutionary differential equations.
The key topics are:
* introduction to exponential integrators
  (overview of traditional methods and the motivation for using exponential
  integrators for stiff differential equations);
* numerical methods for matrix functions (Krylov subspace and other polynomial or 
  rational numerical methods for large-scale systems);
* implementation techniques (practical considerations for implementing
  exponential integrators on modern hardware);
* applications to, e.g., advection-diffusion-reaction and Schrödinger
  equations;
* if time permits, we will present some key points in semigroup theory related to
  the topic.

This advanced course will include lectures and laboratory sessions. Attendees
will gain both theoretical understanding and practical experience.

It is preferred to have some knowledge of standard explicit and implicit numerical
methods for initial value ordinary differential equations (Euler's methods,
Runge-Kutta methods, theta-method) and
evolutionary partial differential equations (finite difference method).

The schedule is the following:
* Every Monday and Wednesday, from January 12 to February 11, from 15:30 to 17:30.

Every lecture will be streamed on zoom (the link is available upon request).
